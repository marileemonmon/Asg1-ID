                TXT (Tomorrow X Together) is a South Korean boy group formed by BigHit Music. 
                They officially debuted on March 4, 2019, and quickly became known for their 
                cinematic storytelling, youth-focused themes, and visually striking concepts. 
                Each comeback often follows a narrative arc that explores friendship, 
                growing pains, self-discovery, and the emotional struggles of adolescence. 
                Their music spans a wide range of genres, including pop, alternative rock, 
                R&amp;B, and EDM, allowing the group to continually reinvent their sound.
                </p>

                <p>
                The group consists of five members: Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun, 
                and Hueningkai. They are widely praised for their strong vocal ability, 
                synchronized choreography, and emotionally expressive performances. 
                TXT has built a reputation as one of the leading groups of the younger 
                K-pop generation, earning global awards, charting on Billboard, and 
                completing multiple world tours. Their fandom is called MOA 
                (“Moments of Alwaysness”), representing the idea that every moment with TXT 
                and fans creates a meaningful connection.
